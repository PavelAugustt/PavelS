            <h3>Why Work With Me?</h3>
            <p>
                I believe the best developers are also great teachers. In my free time, I run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pavelaugust" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where I break down complex topics like CUDA programming and OS internals. This passion for teaching reflects in my work: I build solutions that are not only powerful but also well-documented and easy to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience is broad, spanning from low-level machine learning compilers to full-stack web and game development. This versatility means I can see the bigger picture and tackle challenges from different angles, whether your project needs a robust backend, a fluid user interface, or a complex machine learning model. As a full-time full-stack engineer and part-time project lead, I bring both deep technical skills and the leadership needed to see a project through to success.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I'm comfortable across the stack, my real passion is in low-level development. This fascination with what's "under the hood" drives me to write highly efficient, optimized code, which translates into faster, more reliable, and cost-effective applications for my clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're looking for a dedicated partner to build something great, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out with any contract or freelance opportunities.
